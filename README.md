# E08a-Paddle-Ball
This is the first Godot exercise for BL-MSCH-C220.

In it there is the capability to have a ball that will bounce properly for a game of breakout. We also have the paddle follow the player's mouse which will be the main way the player interacts with the game that will eventually be built from this basic idea.
